SPECIAL ABILITIES
------------------------------
Constrict (Ex) 
 Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) can crush an opponent, dealing 1d6+5 bludgeoning damage, when it makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage).

Trample (Ex) 
 Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) can attempt to overrun any creature that is at least one size category Smaller than itself. This works just like the overrun combat maneuver, but the trampling creature does not need to make a check, it merely has to move over opponents in its path. Targets of a trample take 1d4+8 bludgeoning damage.  Targets of a trample can make an attack of opportunity, but at a ?4 penalty. If targets forgo an attack of opportunity, they can attempt to avoid the trampling creature and receive a Reflex save to take half damage. The save DC against a Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium)?s trample attack is 23.  A trampling creature can only deal trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature.

Engulf (Ex) 
 Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) can engulf creatures in its path as part of a standard action. It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it engulfs. The creature merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a DC 23Reflex save to avoid being engulfed?on a success, they are pushed back or aside (target?s choice) as the creature moves forward. Engulfed opponents gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, are trapped within the creature?s body until they are no longer pinned, and are subject to 1d8 acid damage each round. The save DC is Strength-based.

Hinder Spellcasting (Ex) 
 Whenever a creature attempts to cast a spell in a Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium)'s space or an area it threatens, the caster must make a concentration check of DC 20 + spell level.  Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Will save.

Faith-Stealing Strike (Su) 
 When a Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium)'s natural attack or melee weapon damages a creature capable of casting divine spells, that creature must make a DC 21 will save or become unable to cast divine spells for 1 round. Once a creature makes this save, it is immune to further faith-stealing strikes from that particular Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) The save DC is charisma-based.

Rend (Ex) 
 When a Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) hits with two or more of the same type of natural attacks in 1 round, it causes 1d4+7 damage by latching onto the opponent?s body and tearing flesh. This attack deals an additional amount of damage, but no more than once per round.

Curse (Su) 
 A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) bestows a curse upon its enemies by touching them.  A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium)'s curse has a Will save DC of 21, a frequency of 1 day, and causes 1d6 str drain. Curses can be removed through remove curse and similar effects. The save DC is charisma-based.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) 
A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) has the ability to react to danger before it's senses would normally allow it to do so. A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does it lose it's Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. It still loses it's Dexterity bonus to Armor Class if immobilized. A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) with this ability can still lose it's Dexterity bonus to Armor Class if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against it.
In addition, a Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) cannot be Flanked unless the attacker has at least 20 Rogue levels.

Improved Evasion (Ex) 
A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If a Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage. If the Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) fails its reflex save, it takes half damage instead of full damage. Improved Evasion can be used only if the Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) does not gain the benefit of Improved Evasion.

Slashing Weapon Vulnerability (Ex) 
 A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) takes 50% extra damage from physical attacks that deal slashing damage.

Plantspeech (Ex) 
 A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) can communicate with plants as through a 'Speak with Plants' spell (of caster level 16) constantly.

Aura of Menace (Su) 
 A righteous aura surrounds a Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium).  Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius must succeed on a DC 23 will save to resist its effects. Those who fail take a -2  penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) that generated the aura.  A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium)'s aura for 24 hours. The save DC is charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Envisaging (Su) 
 A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) can communicate wordlessly through thoughts.  A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) can read the thoughts of creatures around it and projects its thoughts into the target in reply. They emit a psychic, wordless flash of their intended message to the target's mind, functioning as a wordless form of telepathy.  A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) cannot read the thoughts of a creature immune to mind-affecting effects.

Stench (Ex) 
 A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) secretes an oily chemical that nearly every other creature finds offensive. All living creatures (except those with Stench) within 30 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 22) or be sickened for 1d6+16 rounds. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same creature?s stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.  The save DC is constitution based.

Aura of Despair (Su) 
 Enemies within 10 feet of a Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) are overcome with despair, and take a ?2 penalty on all saving throws.

Swift Reactions (Ex) 
 A Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) moves and reacts much more swiftly than normal constructs.  They gain 'Improved Initiative' and 'Lightning Reflexes' as bonus feats, and gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC.

Earth Glide (Su) 
 When a Sredelm Mandragonra (Medium) burrows, it can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing the burrowing creature flings it back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
