SPECIAL ABILITIES
------------------------------
Swarm Attack (Ex) 
 A Guhuemust deals 3d6 automatic damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move, with no attack roll needed.  Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance from concealment or cover.

Distraction (Ex) 
 Whenever a Guhuemust damages a creature with a natural attack, it must make a DC 23 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 round.

Hinder Spellcasting (Ex) 
 Whenever a creature attempts to cast a spell in a Guhuemust's space or an area it threatens, the caster must make a concentration check of DC 20 + spell level.  Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Will save.

Masterwork scythe
A Guhuemust wields a Masterwork scythe, the bonuses are included in its stats above.

Swallow Whole (Ex) 
 If a Guhuemust begins its turn with an opponent grappled in its mouth (see Grab), it can attempt a new combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. Unless otherwise noted, the opponent can be up to one size category Smaller than the swallowing creature. Being swallowed causes a creature to take 1d6+5 bludgeoning damage each round.  A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while the creature that did the swallowing does not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is 14).  A Guhuemust's Stomach has 10 AC.  If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the Guhuemust cannot use swallow whole again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in the attacker?s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

Blinding Gaze (Su) 
 An opponent that meets a Guhuemust's gaze within 30ft. becomes blinded for 14 minutes unless they succeed at a DC 17 fortitude save. A successful saving throw negates the effect. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order.  The save DC is charisma-based.

Charming Gaze (Su) 
 An opponent that meets a Guhuemust's gaze within 30ft. becomes charmed (as Charm Person) for 1 day unless they succeed at a DC 17 will save. A successful saving throw negates the effect. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order.  The save DC is charisma-based.

Knowledge-Stealing Strike (Su) 
 When a Guhuemust's natural attack or melee weapon damages a creature capable of casting arcane spells, that creature must make a DC 17 will save or become unable to cast arcane spells for 1 round. Once a creature makes this save, it is immune to further knowledge-stealing strikes from that particular Guhuemust The save DC is charisma-based.

Swarming Mass (Ex) 
 A Guhuemust's body is composed of a swarming mass of smaller creatures, which means it has no front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking.  A swarm made up of tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons.  A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage.  Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or less causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist damage. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage.  Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.
A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of mind-affecting effects if the swarm has an Intellighence score and a hive mind.  A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds, such as those created by a gust of wind spell.  For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures.  A swarm rendered unconscious my means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.
Swarms do not threaten foes and do not make attacks of oppotunity.  A swarm has 0ft reach, like its component creatures.  When a swarm moves into a creature's space to attack, it provokes an attack of oppotunity as normal.

Immunity to Weapon Damage (Ex)
A Guhuemust is immune to damage from physical weapons, including natural weapons.

Miracle and Wish Vulnerability (Su) 
 A spell effect created by a 'Miracle' or 'Wish' spell is particularly effective against a Guhuemust.  A spellcaster gains a +6 bonus on its caster level check to penetrate a Guhuemust's SR with a miracle or wish spell, and the Guhuemust suffers a -6 penalty on saves against these spells.  A 'Miracle' or a 'Wish' spell can negate a Guhuemust's regeneration, but only for 1d4 rounds per casting.

Humanoid Traits
A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head, or a human-like torso, arms, and a head. humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can speak and usually have well-developed societies. They are usually Small or Medium (with the exception of giants). Every humanoid creature also has a specific subtype to match its race, such as human, dark folk, or goblinoid.
-Humanoids breathe, eat, and sleep.

Fear Aura (Su) 
 A Guhuemust radiates a 30ft. aura that will affect everyone entering or standing within as the 'Fear' spell.  This is a mind-affecting fear effect that allows a DC 17 will save to negate.   The save DC is charisma-based.

Stench (Ex) 
 A Guhuemust secretes an oily chemical that nearly every other creature finds offensive. All living creatures (except those with Stench) within 30 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 23) or be sickened for 1d6+14 rounds. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same creature?s stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.  The save DC is constitution based.
