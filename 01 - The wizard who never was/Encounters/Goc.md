SPECIAL ABILITIES
------------------------------
Unnerving Gaze (Su) 
 A Goc can make its face resemble a departed loved one or bitter enemy of anyone looking at it.  An opponent that meets a Goc's gaze within 60ft. becomes shaken for 1d3 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 23 will save. A successful saving throw negates the effect. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order.  The save DC is charisma-based.

Web (Ex) 
 A Goc can use webs to support itself and up to one additional creature of Gargantuan. In addition, a Goc can throw a web up to eight times per day with +7 to hit. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the web spinner. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst the web with a Strength check. Both are standard actions with a DC of 21. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it take a ?4 penalty.  The break DC is constitution-based.
Gocs can create sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section of web has 17 hit points and DR 5/?.  A creature can move across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.

Immunity to Magic (Ex)
A Goc is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows magic resistance.

Light Aversion (Ex) 
 A Goc becomes sickened in bright light.  The penalties from this condition are doubled when the Goc is in natural sunlight.

Bravery (Ex) 
A Goc gains a + 5 on will saves against fear.

Animal Traits
An animal is a living, nonhuman creature, usually a vertebrate with no magical abilities and no innate capacity for language or culture. Animals usually have additional information on how they can serve as companions.
-Low-light vision.
-Animals breathe, eat, and sleep.

Earth Glide (Su) 
 When a Goc burrows, it can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing the burrowing creature flings it back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

Envisaging (Su) 
 A Goc can communicate wordlessly through thoughts.  A Goc can read the thoughts of creatures around it and projects its thoughts into the target in reply. They emit a psychic, wordless flash of their intended message to the target's mind, functioning as a wordless form of telepathy.  A Goc cannot read the thoughts of a creature immune to mind-affecting effects.

Natural Invisibility (Ex) 
 A Goc is constantly invisible at all times, even when attacking. As this ability is inherent, it is not subject to the invisibility purge spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint it, the Goc gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving, or +40 when standing still?these bonuses are not included in the statistics above.
