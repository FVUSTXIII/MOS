SPECIAL ABILITIES
------------------------------
Death Gaze (Su) 
 An opponent that meets a Loda's gaze within 40ft. dies unless they succeed at a DC 18 fortitude save. A successful saving throw negates the effect. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order.  The save DC is charisma-based.

Ghost Touch Attacks (Su) 
 A Loda's natural attacks and any weapons it wields count as though they had the 'Ghost Touch' weapon special quality.

Channel Positive Energy (Su) 
 A Loda can release a wave of positive energy.  This energy can by used to heal living creatures or cause damage to undead (but not both).  A Loda heals or causes 6d6 damage to each creature of the type selected in a 30-foot radius centered on the + Loda.  A Loda can channel energy 6 times per day.  Creatures damaged by the energy gain a will save (DC 18) for half damage.  This is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of oppotunity.

Improved Evasion (Ex) 
A Loda can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If a Loda makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no damage. If the Loda fails its reflex save, it takes half damage instead of full damage. Improved Evasion can be used only if the Loda is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless Loda does not gain the benefit of Improved Evasion.

Bravery (Ex) 
A Loda gains a + 3 on will saves against fear.

Aberration Traits
An aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, an alien mindset, or any combination of the three.
-Darkvision 60 feet.
-Aberrations breathe, eat, and sleep.

Natural Invisibility (Ex) 
 A Loda is constantly invisible at all times, even when attacking. As this ability is inherent, it is not subject to the invisibility purge spell. Against foes that cannot pinpoint it, the Loda gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving, or +40 when standing still?these bonuses are not included in the statistics above.

Darksense (Ex) 
 A Loda gains 'True Seeing' in dim light and darkness.  Regardless of light conditions, they can detect living creatures and their health within 60 feet, as 'Blindsense' with 'Deathwatch' continuously active.  Mind Blank and Nondetection prevent the Blindsense and Deathwatch effect, but not the true seeing.

Aura of Despair (Su) 
 Enemies within 10 feet of a Loda are overcome with despair, and take a ?2 penalty on all saving throws.

Freedom of Movement (Su) 
 A Loda has continuous 'Freedom of Movement', as the spell.

Plantspeech (Ex) 
 A Loda can communicate with plants as through a 'Speak with Plants' spell (of caster level 11) constantly.
