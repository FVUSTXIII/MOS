SPECIAL ABILITIES
------------------------------
Fear Cone (Sp) 
 A Zlemr can project a 70ft. cone that will affect everyone within as the 'Fear' spell.  This is a mind-affecting fear effect that allows a DC 22 will save to negate.   The save DC is charisma-based.

Poison (Ex) 
 A Zlemr can poison those it attacks.  A Zlemr's greataxe attack(s) will inflict a poison on its victims that has a fortitude save DC of 30, a frequency of 1/minute for 6 minutes, causes 1d8 con damage, and takes two saves to cure. The save DC is constitution-based.

Constitution Damage (Su) 
 When a Zlemr touches its foe, it causes 4d6 negative energy damage.  Victims hit by the attack also suffer 3d6 constitution damage unless they succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude Save.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  

Paralyze (Su) 
 When a Zlemr hits a target with its greataxe attack(s), the victim is rendered immobile for 2d6 rounds.  The target is allowed a DC 22 fortitude save to negate the paralysis effect.  Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. The save DC is charisma-based.

Constitution Drain (Su) 
 When a Zlemr touches its foe, it causes 4d6 negative energy damage.  Victims hit by the attack also suffer 3d6 constitution drain unless they succeed on a DC 22 Fortitude Save.  The save DC is Charisma-based.  

Aberration Traits
An aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, an alien mindset, or any combination of the three.
-Darkvision 60 feet.
-Aberrations breathe, eat, and sleep.

Envisaging (Su) 
 A Zlemr can communicate wordlessly through thoughts.  A Zlemr can read the thoughts of creatures around it and projects its thoughts into the target in reply. They emit a psychic, wordless flash of their intended message to the target's mind, functioning as a wordless form of telepathy.  A Zlemr cannot read the thoughts of a creature immune to mind-affecting effects.
