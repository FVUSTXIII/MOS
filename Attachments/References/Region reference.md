## **Tundra**

It is a climate which at least one month has an average temperature high enough to melt snow (0 °C [32 °F]), but no month with an average temperature in excess of 10 °C (50 °F). If the climate occurs at high elevations, it is known as alpine climate.

### Continental
 The definition of this climate in terms of temperature is as follows: the mean temperature of the coldest month must be below 0 °C (32.0 °F) or −3 °C (26.6 °F) depending on the isotherm,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate#cite_note-kottek2006-2) and there must be at least four months whose mean temperatures are at or above 10 °C (50 °F). In addition, the location in question must not be [semi-arid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate "Semi-arid climate") or [arid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_climate "Desert climate"). The cooler _Dfb_, _Dwb_, and _Dsb_ subtypes are also known as [hemiboreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiboreal "Hemiboreal") climates.
 
Humid continental climates are generally found between latitudes [40° N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40th_parallel_north "40th parallel north") and [60° N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_parallel_north "60th parallel north"),[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate#cite_note-3) within the central and northeastern portions of [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America"), [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe"), and [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia"). Occasionally, they can also be found at higher elevations above other more temperate climate types. They are rare in the [Southern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere), limited to isolated high altitude locations, due to the larger ocean area at that latitude, smaller land mass, and the consequent greater maritime moderation.
